														// negative is placed last; ensure options with arguments preceed toggle 
														// (aka flag) options; limitdiag should folloow last argument, followed
														// by any flag options for this command. Options (apart from limitdiag) 
														// common to all stackMe `cmd's will be added in stackmeWrapper.
														// CHECK THAT NO OTHER OPTIONS, BEYOND THE FIRST 3, NAME ANY VARIABLE(S)	**

	local prfxtyp = /*"var"*/"othr"						// Nature of varlist prefix â€“ var(list) or other. (`depvarname will			**
														// be referred to as `opt1', the first word of `optMask', in codeblock 
														// (0) of stackmeWrapper called just below). `opt1' is always the name 
														// of an option that holds a varname or varlist (which must be referred
														// using double-quotes). Normally the variable named in `opt1' can be 
														// updated by the prefix to a varlist, but not in genyhats.
