{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:genmeans} generates mean values of variables in {it:varlist}, separately for each stack and 
context (if specified). These means can be weighted as though deriving from statistical analyses.

{pstd}
The {cmd:genmeans} command can be issued before or after stacking. If issued before stacking the 
variable list will name members of an item battery that, after stacking, will provide the values 
of a single variable (see {bf:{help genstacks:genstacks}}). If issued after stacking it 
determines the mean across units (often respondents) for each item/stack separately within each 
higher-level context. In either case the resulting mean will be constant across units/respondents 
within items/stacks and within contexts.

{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt con:textvars(varlist)} if present, variables whose combinations identify different 
contexts (e.g. country and year) for each of which mean values will be generated (same value 
for all units/respondents in each context). By default all units are assumed to belong to the 
same context.

{phang}
{opt pre:fix(name)} if present, prefix for the generated mean variables (default is "m_"). 

{phang}
{opth stackid(varname)} if present, a variable identifying each different "stack" (equivalent to 
the {it:j} index in Stata's {bf:{help reshape:reshape long}} command) for which means will be separately 
generated in the absence of the {cmd:nostack} option. The default is to use the "genmeans_stack" 
variable if the {cmd:genmeans} command is issued after stacking.

{phang}
{opt nostack} if present, overrides the default behavior of treating each stack as a separate 
context (has no effect if data are not stacked). This option is not compatible with option 
{it:cweight} because those are weights that apply to each stack.

{phang}
{opt cwe:ight(varname)} if present, provides a weight (constant across respondents) to be applied 
at the battery/stack level. It supplements conventional weights, which can still be specified 
as usual, earlier in the command line. The {bf:cmean} option requires stacked data and is 
incompatible with option {bf:nostack}.{p_end}

{phang}
{opt nor:eport} suppress dianostic output regarding variables created for each context.{p_end}


{title:Examples:}

{pstd}The following command, issued before stacking, generates means named "m_educ" and "m_income" 
for the different contexts found in the data.{p_end}

{phang2}{cmd:. genmeans educ income, context(cid year) weight(wt)}{p_end}{break}

{pstd}The following command, issued after stacking, generates weighted mean locations of governing 
parties where weights are derived from votes received (essentially a measure of where governments 
are located in left-right terms). NOTE that the cweight would first have to be set to 0 for parties/
stacks belonging to non-governing parties, otherwise the measure would relate to the whole 
legislature rather than to the government.{p_end}

{phang2}{cmd:. genmeans plr, prefix(gov_) context(cid year) cweight(votepct)}{p_end}{break}

{title:Generated variables}


{pstd}
{cmd:genmeans} saves the following variables or set of variables:

{synoptset 13 tabbed}{...}
{synopt:m_{it:var1} m_{it:var2} ... (or other prefix set by option {bf:prefix})} a set of context-
specific means held in variables named p_var1, p_var2, etc., where the names var1, var2, etc. 
match the original variable names in {it:varlist}. Those variables are left unchanged. Generated  
for unstacked data.{p_end}

{synopt:m_{it:vara} [m_{it:varb} ... (or other prefix set by option {bf:prefix})} a (set of 
(different) variable(s) holding the mean for each stack in each context for the variable(s) in 
{it:varlist}. Generated for stacked data.{p_end}{break}


NOTE: We should consider using the same syntax for weighting as used in statistical analyses; also 
subsetting by permitting an "if" suffix to the genmeans command (would avoid the need for clumsy 
messing with cweights â€“ see NOTE to 2nd example above). cweights would still be treated  
as options.
